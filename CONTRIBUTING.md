If you find any discrepencies with the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05424v2) open an issue describing the errors. These will usually be in the form of-

- Architecture improvements
- Hyperparameters

Besides these, additional functionality is also welcome. Currently, the implementing the following functionality would be a good starting point-

- Additional visualizations to log in TensorBoard
- Additional dataset options
